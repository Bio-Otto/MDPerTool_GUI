- Sphinx documentation

### Fixed
- Clipboard pasting works on OS X and Windows

### Changed

## [1.0.7] - 2016-12-01
### Added
- Low-pass filtering function for the voltage signal
- First stage ignition delay is automatically calculated

### Fixed
- Errors in computing the temperature are caught now, instead of crashing the analysis
- Eliminate deprecation warning about `ReactorNet.step()` by checking the version of Cantera being used

### Changed
- Change offset for ignition delay calculation from 5 ms to 2 ms
- Use FFT convolve from `scipy` instead of `convolve` from `numpy` because the FFT was 100x faster
- The voltage is low-pass filtered and then moving-average smoothed, rather than just being smoothed
- Increase the smoothing window for the derivative from 5 to 151
- The compression time from the YAML file is used as the end time when fitting the initial period of the pressure trace

- Refactor `voltage` variable name to be `signal`
- Smooth the voltage first, then compute the pressure, rather than the other way around

## [1.0.1] - 2015-07-16
### Added
- Filename for the reactive experiment is loaded from the `volume-trace.yaml` file
